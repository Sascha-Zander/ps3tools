Sorry about the fucked up tabs, TAB = 4 SPACES 4 LYFE!!!
Add the files in the npdrm_keystuff folder to your ps3 keys folder. Create a
file with your console's 16 byte IDPS in the 'idps' file in your ps3 keys
folder (e.g. ~/.ps3/idps).
Copy your PS3's exdata folder containing your act.dat and rif files to your
ps3 keys dir (e.g. ~/.ps3/exdata/act.dat). Compile and have fun with your
LEGALLY purchased NPDRM games!

Also works on free games without exdata/idps.

Apologies for any existing bugs in unself. Adding these changes to
unself2 is left as an exercise for the reader.

v2 info:
Added npdrm magic to unself2 and readself2
unself2 doesn't like the metadata section with type 3 in my game.
This section looks to be some kind of linking information. Here is a snippet:
crt0:p190002crt1:p190002libaudio_stub:p190002libaudio_stub:p190002

I haven't yet looked around to see if this is type of section is documented anywhere.



Thanks:
fail0verflow for the orginal tools
JuanNadie for figuring out NPDRM
euss for his endless hours of work on the wiki

Why didn't you beat me to the punch, Team PS360? I didn't need to reverse a
single instruction! It isn't that hard...
